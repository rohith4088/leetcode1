    "### HASHTABLES\n",
    "##Hash Tables are data structures which generally provide very fast(O(1)) lookups, insertions and deletions\n",
    "#In Python, dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.\n",
    "#The way hashing works is that there is a bucket containing slots to fill with elements.\n",
    "#Like in arrays, elements are referenced by their integer indexes, in dictionaries, or hash tables,\n",
    "#values are referenced by their keys, which can be of any data type.\n",
    "#Now there are different kinds of hash functions (eg: MD5, SHA1, SHA256) which are used to convert the keys into hashes, which are unique for each key\n",
    "#And the hashes are then mapped to some slot in the bucket. And the key and value pair get stored in the slot,\n",
    "#or in some accompanying data structure within the slot (like, linked lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "#In general, the lookup, insert and delete operations all are very fast, in the order of O(1)\n",
    "#But in some cases, more than one keys can map to the same slot and that increases the time complexity by some margin,\n",
    "#although not by a lot in most cases. This is known as a collision.\n",
    "#Now, like for almost all problem there is some sort of a solution in the computer science world,\n",
    "#collisions can also be resolved by numerous collision resolution techniques like open addressing and closed addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "#Enough details, let's look at how hash tables are implemented in Python using dictionaries.\n",
    "#Data ais stored in an associative manner \n",
    "#applications\n",
    "# to prevent sensitive data, such as web analytics, passwords, and payment details.\n",
    "# To encrypt information exchange between browsers and web servers, and create session IDs for data caching and internet applications.\n",
    "# To find identical data through lookup functions.\n",
