This file contains the basic information about EXCEPTION HANDLING IN PYTHON

-->EXCEPTION IS JUST AN OBJECT
-->The one thing that is common is that all exception INHERITS from the built-in class called BaseException
--> Erros and EXCEPTIONS are used interchangebly
-->if we stack exception clauses like we did in the preceding example, only the first
matching clause will be run, even if more than one of them fits. How can more
than one clause match? Remember that exceptions are objects, and can therefore be
subclassed. As we'll see in the next section, most exceptions extend the Exception
class (which is itself derived from BaseException). If we catch Exception before
we catch TypeError, then only the Exception handler will be executed, because
TypeError is an Exception by inheritance.
--> two key exceptions, SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt, that derive directly from BaseException instead of Exception.
--> When we use the except: clause without specifying any type of exception, it will
catch all subclasses of BaseException
--> if you do want to catch all exceptions, I suggest using the syntax
except BaseException: instead of a raw except:. This helps explicitly tell future
readers of your code that you are intentionally handling the special case exceptions.


EXPLAIN EXCPTION HANDLING TO A CHILD
-->Imagine you're building a Lego tower. Sometimes, when you're adding a new piece, it might not fit right or the tower might fall over. When that happens, you don't want to stop playing. Instead, you want to find a way to fix it and keep building.
-->In Python, when you're writing a program, things can go wrong too. Maybe you try to divide a number by zero or open a file that doesn't exist. These mistakes are called "exceptions."
-->Exception handling in Python is like having a safety net for your Lego tower. When something goes wrong, instead of crashing the whole program, Python lets you catch the mistake, figure out what went wrong, and then decide what to do next.
