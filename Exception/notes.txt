This file contains the basic information about EXCEPTION HANDLING IN PYTHON

-->EXCEPTION IS JUST AN OBJECT
-->The one thing that is common is that all exception INHERITS from the built-in class called BaseException
--> Erros and EXCEPTIONS are used interchangebly
-->if we stack exception clauses like we did in the preceding example, only the first
matching clause will be run, even if more than one of them fits. How can more
than one clause match? Remember that exceptions are objects, and can therefore be
subclassed. As we'll see in the next section, most exceptions extend the Exception
class (which is itself derived from BaseException). If we catch Exception before
we catch TypeError, then only the Exception handler will be executed, because
TypeError is an Exception by inheritance.
